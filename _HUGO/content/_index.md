Standardese aims to be a nextgen [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org).

It consists of two parts: a library and a tool.

The library aims at becoming *the* documentation frontend that can be easily extended and customized. It parses C++ code with the help of [libclang](http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html) and provides access to it.

The tool drives the library to generate documentation for user-specified files. It supports a couple of output formats including Markdown and HTML as well as experimental Latex and Man pages.
