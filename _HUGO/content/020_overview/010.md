standardese looks for documentation comments as shown in the following example:

```cpp
/// A regular C++ style documentation comment.
/// Multiple C++ style comments are merged automatically.
///   This line has *two* leading whitespaces because one is always skipped.

//! A C++ style comment using an exclamation mark.
/// It will also merge with other C++ style comments.
//! But don't worry, also with the exclamation mark styles.

/** A C style documentation commment. */
/** This is a different comment, they aren't merged.
 * But you can be fancy with the star at the beginning of the line.
 * It will ignore all whitespace, the star and the first following whitespace.
 */

/*! You can also use an exclamation mark. */
/// But neither will merge with any other comment.

int x; //< An end-of-line comment.
/// It will merge with C++ style comments.
int y; //< But this is a different end-of-line comment.
```

A comment corresponds to the entity on the line directly below or on the same line.
You can document all entities that way except files (use `file` command), namespaces (use `entity` command),
and inline entities such as parameters or base classes (use `param/tparam/base` command or `entity` command).

Inside the comment you can use arbitrary\* Markdown\* in the documentation comments and it will be rendered appropriately.

> The Markdown flavor used is [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org).
> standardese does not support inline HTML (for obvious reasons) or images.
> Inline HTML that isn't a raw HTML block will be treated as literal text.
> This allows writing `vector<T>` without markup or escaping in the comment, for example.

*Note: CommonMark allows hard line breaks with a backslash at the end of the line.
But the C preprocessor uses a backslash to combine multiple lines into one.
For that reason you cannot use a backslash there,
instead you can use a forward slash.*
