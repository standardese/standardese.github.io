### Very Easy: Pre-compiled Binaries

TODO

### Easy: Docker

The easiest way to build standardese is to download the docker image `foonathan/standardese_dev` and run it like so:

```
docker pull foonathan/standardese_dev
docker run -v "/path/to/standardese/source:/root/standardese" -v "$(pwd):/root/output" foonathan/standardese_dev
```

It will compile `standardese` as a fully statically linked binary and copy it to the current working directory.
The binary is compatible with any Linux distribution.

### Harder: Building From Source

The build system takes care of all dependencies automatically, except for two: Boost and libclang.

It needs to have Boost.ProgramOptions and Boost.Filesystem as statically linked binaries.
If they're installed, they should be found automatically.

It also needs libclang.
If you are under a Linux system, it should find the `llvm-config` binary automatically and everything works,
otherwise things are a bit harder.
Read the [cppast build instructions](https://github.com/foonathan/cppast#installation) for more information, they also apply here.

Once they're installed, compiling is a simple:

```
cmake /path/to/standardese/source
cmake --build . --target standardese_tool
```

The result is the executable `tool/standardese`.
