You can also link to external documentations via the tool option `--comment.external_doc prefix=url`.
All `unique-name`s starting with `prefix` will be linked to the `url`.
If the `url` contains two dollar signs `$$`, they will be replaced by the `unique-name`.
By default the tool supports http://en.cppreference.com/w/ with a prefix of `std::` by default.

> You can override to a different URL by specifying `--comment.external_doc std::=new-url`.
