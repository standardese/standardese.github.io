A *inline* is a special kind of command.
They are `param`, `tparam` and `base` and used to document (template) parameters and base classes,
because you cannot put a corresponding comment there.
As such they are shorthands for the `\entity unique-name` command.
They are followed by the name of entity they refer to.

The *inline* and argument is stripped from the text.
The rest of the line will be treated as `brief` documentation.
Like a *section*, an *inline* ends when a new special command or hard line break is encountered or a paragraph ends.
You can include sections in inlines, however.

For example:

```cpp
/// Normal documentation for the function.
///
/// \param foo Brief documentation for the parameter `foo`.
/// It continues here with details.
/// \param bar
/// \exclude
///
/// The `\exclude` is part of the documentation for `bar`.
void func(int foo, int bar);
```
